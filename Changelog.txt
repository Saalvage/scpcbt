	- Night Vision Goggles

	- Achievement menu
- New difficulty system:
	- Safe: basically the same as the old Euclid-mode
	- Euclid: you can only save at computer- and security monitors
	- Keter: permadeath and more aggressive SCPs (higher spawnrates and some
	of them chase the player more actively instead of wandering around randomly)
	- Custom: self explanatory
- A new room in the pocket dimension (replaces the room with the floating clouds of smoke)
- Some changes to the maintenance tunnel
- The SCPs that can "teleport" from waypoint to another (such as 173) can no longer
teleport to waypoints next to the player, so 173 shouldn't pop up from nowhere anymore

- a minor layout change to the room after the intro sequence
- added some new sound effects

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.7
- FIVE new SCPs
- improved map generation algorithm - now the map is divided into three "zones" 
("light containment", "heavy containment" and an office/research zone). Due to
this, the layout of the facility now makes much more sense: you won't be seeing 
a toilet or an office next to the containment chamber of a Keter-level SCP anymore.
- lots of new rooms
- plenty of new scripted events, including:
	- scenes where you'll witness the staff trying to escape the facility with
	varied success
	- an event where SCP-096 gets to do more than just sit on the floor
- new items
- ambient sounds that are played near specific objects/areas, such as the sound of
dripping water near a pipe or a quiet humming sound near a ventilation shaft
- some optimization to 096's AI, it shouldn't cause FPS drops as much as before
- some small additions to the intro sequence
- minor visual improvements to the smoke
- SCP-173 model with heavily reduced polycount (from ~14,000 to ~2,200)
- more security cameras placed around the facility

- some changes to 096's sound clips
- a 096 loading screen

- the guard in the intro no longer freezes if you go to the end of the hallway
- optimized the blur effect a bit
- fixed the bug that caused SCP-106 to get stuck inside its containment cell
if you turned off the magnets after recontaining it. So now it's possible to
release it after it has been contained.
- fixed the "Femur breaker" -sign in 106's containment room
- fixed the decals that appear when SCP-106 spawns (so, the "cracks" are back)

find a path to the player

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.6
- Another exit and more endings
- Crouching and hiding mechanics
- Improved intro sequence (still a work in progress)
- Better Class D models, although they're still just placeholders
- Improved MTF AI. Now they head to the last location the player was spotted in, and 
start randomly searching for him. They'll also try to recontain SCP-106 when they
reach it's chamber.
- An injury/bloodloss system, so now it's possible (although hard) to survive being 
shot. Gunshot wounds make you bleed, and losing too much blood eventually kills you.
Injuries can be healed with first aid kits, but it takes some time (so you can't just 
start bandaging a wound while you're being shot at) and a regular first aid kit
won't heal you completely. The degree of the injuries depends on which part of your 
body got hit - headshots are still instakill.
- Type "injure [0-5]" in the console if you want to check out the injury system
- Ballistic vests which reduce the damage taken from gunshots
- New SCP-106 model
- Some new scripted events

- Some new rooms
- A subtle "zoom effect" when you're looking at SCP-173 or SCP-106
- A console command for spawning items (spawnitem [the name of the item])
- An anomalous duck
- A ton of small bugfixes

- ...And a last minute addition, SCP-096. It's using a placeholder model made by
Mirocaine until we get a better one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.5
- GATE B and multiple endings. So now it's possible to get out and BEAT THE GAME.
- Mobile Task Force groups whose job is to clear the facility of the escaped
SCPs and other potential hazards (they still need some tweaking and their AI may 
be a bit buggy at times)
- some new rooms (including the silo of the Omega Warhead)
- improved map generation algorithm:
	- it shouldn't generate maps that are impossible to get through anymore
	- no more of those black "fake walls"
- SCP-106 uses an A*-based pathfinding algorithm, so now it won't just float
towards the player through the map
