# Do not try to play this expecting a remotely finished experience. You cannot move between zones, the performance is horrible and bugs are plentiful.

A mod I made years ago featuring some cool stuff like localization support, separate zone loading and fixed timesteps, as well as a compilation of a bunch of helpful resources. It requires [my own B3D fork](https://github.com/Saalvage/Blitz3D) to compile.

If you are someone who is interested in modding I would not recommend using this fork as a base. There's weird stuff going on with fixed timesteps and the menus and without the necessary technical knowledge this will be very hard to fix, just take portions of the code that you'd like to use in your mod and you should be able to *salvage* a lot of the cooler stuff in here.
