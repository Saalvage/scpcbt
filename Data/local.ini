427="Requesting support from MTF Nu-7. We need more firepower to take this thing down."
895="What we know is that he died of cardiac arrest. My guess is that it was caused by SCP-895, although it has never been observed affecting video equipment from this far before. Further testing is needed to determine whether SCP-895's 'Red Zone' is increasing."
895snv="Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, presumably enhanced by SCP-914. It might be possible that the subject was able to resist the memetic effects partially through these goggles. The goggles have been stored for further study."
895nv="Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, killing him."
895nov="What the hell is he wearing and how the f___ did he die, I want answers NOW!"
914="A heavily mutilated corpse found inside the output booth of SCP-914. DNA testing identified the corpse as Class D Subject D-9341. The subject had obviously been 'refined' by SCP-914 on the 'Rough' setting, but we are still confused as to how he ended up inside the intake booth and who or what wound the key."
939="All four (4) escaped SCP-939 specimens have been captured and recontained successfully. Three (3) of them made quite a mess at Storage Area 6. A cleaning team has been dispatched."
1025="He died of a cardiac arrest after reading SCP-1025, that's for sure. Is there such a thing as psychosomatic cardiac arrest, or does SCP-1025 have some anomalous properties we are not yet aware of?"
1048a=A dead body covered in ears was found in [REDACTED]. Subject was presumably attacked by an instance of SCP-1048-A and suffocated to death by the ears. Body was sent for autopsy.
1123=Subject D-9341 was shot dead after attempting to attack a member of Nine-Tailed Fox. Surveillance tapes show that the subject had been wandering around the site approximately 9 minutes prior, shouting the phrase "get rid of the four pests" in chinese. SCP-1123 was found in [REDACTED] nearby, suggesting the subject had come into physical contact with it. How exactly SCP-1123 was removed from its containment chamber is still unknown.
1162=A dead Class D subject was discovered within the containment chamber of SCP-1162. An autopsy revealed that his right lung was missing, which suggests interaction with SCP-1162.
1499=An unidentified male and a deceased Class D subject were discovered in [REDACTED] by the Nine-Tailed Fox. The man was described as highly agitated and seemed to only speak Russian. He's been taken into a temporary holding area at [REDACTED] while waiting for a translator to arrive.
1499incident=All personnel situated within Evacuation Shelter LC-2 during the breach have been administered Class-B amnestics due to Incident 1499-E. The Class D subject involved in the event died shortly after being shot by Agent [REDACTED].
mtf=Subject D-9341. Terminated by Nine-Tailed Fox.
mtfblood=Subject D-9341. Died of blood loss after being shot by Nine-Tailed Fox.
guardstart=Subject D-9341. Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head. The surveillance tapes confirm that the subject was terminated by Agent Ulgrin shortly after the site lockdown was initiated.
guardgate="Agent G. to control. Eliminated a Class D escapee in Gate B's courtyard."
apachea="CH-2 to control. Shot down a runaway Class D at Gate A."
apacheb="CH-2 to control. Shot down a runaway Class D at Gate B."
tentaclechamber="We will need more than the regular cleaning team to take care of this. Two large and highly active tentacle-like appendages seem to have formed inside the chamber. Their level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like they have beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
tentacleoffice="One large and highly active tentacle-like appendage seems to have grown outside the dead body of a scientist within office area [REDACTED]. Its level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like it has beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
killbat=Subject D-9341 found dead inside SCP-914's output booth next to what appears to be an ordinary nine-volt battery. The subject is covered in severe electrical burns, and assumed to be killed via an electrical shock caused by the battery. The battery has been stored for further study.
tesla=Subject D-9341 killed by the Tesla gate at [REDACTED].
suicidevest=Subject D-9341 has through as of yet unknown means obtained an explosive vest. Gunfire by Nine-Tailed Fox caused the vest to explode, killing the subject instantly and wounding one (1) Nine-Tailed Fox operative. Vests of this kind are not carried by Site-19, research ongoing.
